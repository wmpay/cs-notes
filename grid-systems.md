# Grid and design philosophy

- The use of the grid system implies
	- will to systematize
	- will to concentrate
	- will to cultivate objectivity
	- will to rationalize creative and technical production processes
	- will to integrate elements of color, form, material
	- will to achieve architectural dominion over surface and space
	- will to adopt positive forward looking attitude

# The typographic grid

- grid divides two/three dimensional space into smaller fields/compartments
- fields are seperated by intermediate space
- vertical distance between fields is 1, 2 or more lines of text
- horizontal distance depends on type of character and illustrations
- the fewer the differences in the size of illustrations, the quiter the impression created by the design
- suitable grid makes it easier
	- to construct argument objectively w/ means of visual communication
	- to construct material systematically and logically
	- to organize text & illustrations in a compact arrangement
	- to put together visual material so that is intelligible

# The typographic measuring system

- point system - based on the French foot (30cm)
- depth of type (top to bottom) is called point size or body
- width of letters is set or width
- 9 point - bourgeois
- 14 point - english
- etc...
- 1 cicero = 12 points
- 26 cicero, 8 points = 12 cm
- line gauge = 30cm contains 798 typographic points

# Typeface alphabets

- gutenberg first moveable type 1436-1455
- berthold, helvetica, folio, univers produce pleasant and easily legible type areas
- garamond is pretty good too
- sketch words and sentances by hand to get a feel
- caslon - english style
- baskerville - precise geometrical proportions
- bodoni - thin hair lines w/ heavy main strokes
- clarendon - powerful face for advertising
- berthold - sans-serif, almost equal thickness of vertical and horizontal strokes
- times - designed with newspaper printing in mind, highly legible
- helvetica - based on berthold - differences - horizontally cut ends of c, e, g, s, shorter vertical strokes, improves legibility
- univers - most widely used sans-serif face, available in many sizes

# Width of column

- design, format, legibility are all equaly important
- make it easy for the reader
- 7-10 words per line (based on a well known emperical rule)
- long lines cause reader to keep horizontal line over long distance
- short lines cause reader to skip vertically too much
- find something in the middle
- to choose a width of column which makes text easy to read is one of the most important typographic problems
- space between lines (leading) is important too as to not distract the reader with the next line

# Leading

- lines too close together are distracting
- too far apart are hard to skip between
- if there are various type sizes, leading must be adjusted accordingly
- leading can be adjusted based on the type of media... e.g. a poem might have larger leading to break up lines more

# Margin proportions

- marginal proportions have historically been calculated using mathematical formulae e.g. golden section
- a good design will create maximum tension in the proportions of the margin
- in printing, margins helped to reduce errors that would happen if print was too close to the edge of the page
- top margin is important to make sure text doesn't look like it's 'flying off the page'
- too low and it looks like it's falling out of the page
- top margin and size margin should not be the same size. this is boring

# Page numbers
- folio = page number
- placement can be top/bottom/left/right of text
- however, the width of margin should determine the placement
- usually not placed in outside margin
- central folio have static effect, margin ones have dynamic effect
- if placed on side, distance from text should equal width of columns of type
- if below or above, leading should be 1 line

# Body and display faces

- the face used for a body of work i.e. the text proper
- title should be dependant on general design
- if more than one type face is used, the difference must be clearly recognizable
- size difference easy way to achieve this
- bold/semi-bold etc is another way
